# Udacity Restaurant Review
## General
This restaurant review app was created during the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. 

## Overview
The aim of the Restaurant Reviews project was, to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. The static design that lacks accessibility should be converted to a responsive one which displays on different sized displays and is accessible for screen reader use. Also a service worker had to be added for a seamless offline experience for the users.

## Installation
To run the application:

Download the GitHub zip file or clone the repository onto your PC.
- In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.
- In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to [Python's](https://https://www.python.org) website to download and install the software.
- Note - For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as python by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
- With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
